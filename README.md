Etherscan is the most trusted tool for navigating through all the public data on the Ethereum blockchain and is sometimes called ‚ÄúEthplorer.‚Äù This data includes transaction data, wallet addresses, smart contracts and much more. The application is self-contained and is neither sponsored nor administered by the Ethereum Foundation, which is a non-profit organization.

The team behind Etherscan includes seasoned developers and industry professionals, who developed the Etherscan app to make the Ethereum blockchain more accessible to everyday users.

Although Etherscan is a centralized platform, the app does make it easier for people to search through the Ethereum blockchain.
